# Open High Low (OHL) Trading Research

## Overview
Open High Low trading is a specific intraday trading pattern that focuses on price action during the first hour of trading and subsequent movements. This document compiles research and observations about this trading strategy.

## Key Steps for OHL Trading

1. **Pre-Trade Analysis**
   - Keep an eye on Nifty before taking trades
   - If Nifty is too bullish (Open gap up and stays up with VWAP up), avoid trading for the day
   - HM (Heikin Ashi Moving Average) indicator confirms the same

2. **Trade Setup (9:15 - 9:30)**
   - At 9:15, search for open high/low patterns
   - Open charts of maximum 3 stocks
   - Analyze all aspects of these stocks for next 15 minutes
   - Check Day timeframe for:
     * Trend (SMA 20 above/below)
     * Bollinger Bands high/low
     * Previous Support/Resistance
     * Pivot points
     * HM indicator

3. **Trade Entry (9:30)**
   - Take trade near VWAP
   - Set stop loss at day's high/low
   - Targets can be:
     * SMA 20
     * Previous Support/Resistances
     * Pivot points on 15 mins
   - Can use trailing stop loss of SMA 20 if price moves against SMA 20

## Key Observations

### Timing and Volatility
- Early hours show very high volatility
- Best prices for trades come after 10 AM
- 9:30 15-minute candle is optimal entry point if long-term trend is confirmed
- Best entries near SMA 20 or near day's low/high
- Price correction typically happens between 12 PM - 2 PM

### Pattern Characteristics
- Open highs (bearish) are more common than open lows (bullish)
- HM crossover is ideal trend indicator during initial movement
- Crossovers are consistent after at least one candle close
- Safest trades are when SMA 20 is already in desired direction

### Risk Management
- Avoid cases with huge movement in first 15 mins
- This usually exhausts the movement and leaves little profit potential
- Use only 15 mins timeframe for trend analysis during the day
- HM useful for identifying price fluctuations
- CPR (Central Pivot Range) in 15 min is very useful

## Advanced Pattern Recognition

### Strong Indicators
1. **Daily Timeframe Analysis**
   - Verify Trend (SMA 20 position)
   - Check BB high/low
   - Analyze Pivot points
   - Monitor HM indicator

2. **Hourly Timeframe**
   - Use for confirmation of short-term trend
   - Deep HM provides strong confirmation

3. **VWAP Strategy**
   - Take trades near VWAP
   - Use day's high/low as stop loss
   - Consider previous support/resistance levels

### Pattern Variations
1. **Strong Stocks**
   - Heavy movement with wide BB
   - Very low HM (if lower direction with red line around 30 or low)
   - Stayed low for significant portion of day
   - Best to invest near VWAP

2. **Open High with Positive Price**
   - Tendency to test resistance (high)
   - Returns to SMA 20 or lower
   - Best traded either:
     * Near High price
     * Wait for Heiken Ashi candle to turn red in 15 min

## Risk Management Rules

1. **Entry Rules**
   - Don't rush into trades
   - Enter when price is near VWAP
   - For trades near high/low, wait for clear trend confirmation
   - Wait for candle close after approaching high/low

2. **Volume Considerations**
   - High volume drives price movement but doesn't guarantee direction
   - ATR (Average True Range) will be high
   - Use ATR during trades for movement insights

3. **Stop Loss Management**
   - Initial stop loss at day's high/low
   - Can trail stop loss using SMA 20
   - Consider using pivot points for stop loss adjustment

## Additional Notes

1. **Market Context**
   - Always verify Nifty trend before trading
   - Avoid trading if Nifty shows strong bullish gap up
   - HM indicator can confirm market conditions

2. **Timeframe Analysis**
   - Always verify daily trend before any move
   - Check HM in daily timeframe
   - Verify distance between RSI lines and red line
   - Larger distance indicates stronger trend

3. **Position Management**
   - Typical holding period is 6 days for directional impact
   - 1% move typically achievable in 2-3 days
   - Consider exiting if no clear direction after 6 days

## Success Metrics
- Risk up to 1-1.5% on a trade
- Aim for return at least 0.2% higher than risk amount
- If stop loss exceeds 2%, prepare for longer trade duration (up to 6 days)
- Keep tweaking HM parameters in chartink for more suitable trades
